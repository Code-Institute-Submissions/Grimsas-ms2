Type in Blizzard is a spelling and typing game aimed at kids. The goal is to type given words either with a keyboard or with the letters floating on the touch screen. The more words you type in correctly in two minutes, the bigger the score, but player gets negative points for errors. At the end player can see how many words he was able to type, how many letters he pressed on correctly and how many mistakes were made. This game helps to learn correct spelling of different difficulty words, helps with keyboard letter placement recognition and creates environment where a player competes with himself putting effort to simultaneously improve his spelling skills and score

## The why

As a father of seven year old I am able to see first hand how helpful are learning games to overcome learning boredoms and have some real results through learn and play environment. I was intrigued to create a game, that would erase the concept of learning and create the feeling of urgency to recall words fast and correct, while keeping busy trying to catch floating bubbles. Also I saw the opportunity to use the same concept for keyboard letter placement learning, as it is a inevitable and necessary skill, that might be improved by game of this kind. Kids are incredibly tech savvy therefore I saw it fitting to create a "non teaching" but actually in fact teaching platform to create skills through play, enjoy same game through different interface's
