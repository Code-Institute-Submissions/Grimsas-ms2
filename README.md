Type in Blizzard is a spelling and typing game aimed at kids. The goal is to type given words either with a keyboard or with the letters floating on the touch screen. The more words you type incorrectly in two minutes, the bigger the score, but the player gets negative points for errors. In the end, the player can see how many words he was able to type, how many letters he pressed on correctly and how many mistakes were made. This game helps to learn the correct spelling of different difficulty words, helps with keyboard letter placement recognition and creates an environment where a player competes with himself putting effort to improve his spelling skills and score simultaneously.

## The why

As a father of seven-year-old, I can see first hand how helpful are learning games to overcome learning boredoms and have some real results through learning and play environment.
I was intrigued to create a game, that would erase the concept of learning and create a feeling of urgency to recall words fast and correct while keeping busy trying to catch floating bubbles. Also, I saw the opportunity to use the same concept for keyboard letter placement learning, as it is an inevitable and necessary skill, that might be improved by a game of this kind. Kids are incredibly tech-savvy; therefore, I saw it fitting to create a "non-teaching" but actually, in fact, teaching platform to create skills through play, enjoy the same game through different interface's.
